## Overview

The goal of this small project is to create a tool that extends a fantasy board game.

The program simulates the arrangement of the pieces on the game grid and its task is to calculate and provide at the user's request:
1. The number of pieces on the map for each type
2. The cell with the highest defense value during the day
3. The cell with the highest defense value at night
4. The cell with the highest attack value by day
5. The cell with the highest attack value at night
6. The box with the most pieces of the same type

The language used for the explanation of the code and for the documents is Italian.

## RASD
The _Requirement Analysis and Specification Document_ (RASD) aims at illustrating a overview of the project, providing a baseline for its planning and development. It guides the reader in understanding **functional requirements**, **non functional requirements**, **constraints** and **system architecture**.
